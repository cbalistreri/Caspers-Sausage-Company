# Casper’s Sausage Company: A Strategic Digital & Social Media Plan
## By: Camille Balistreri
### May, 2021

Background

In 2008, my grandparents, Casper (Cappy) and Sara Balistreri began their own company making homemade Italian sausage in their hometown of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This initiative followed the selling of the Venice Club, an authentic Italian restaurant that was their life’s work. They owned and operated the restaurant for nearly 30 years after taking it over from Cappy’s mother, my great-grandmother. The sausage company has brought success to my extended family in the past decade. Over the years my grandparents have become staples of their Italian-American community in the Milwaukee area and have dozens of lifelong customers that followed them from the restaurant business to the sausage company. They sell their different varieties of sausage primarily at a local farmers market, as well as wholesale to restaurants.

Current Online Presence

Both Cappy and Sara are in their late 70’s and therefore know little to nothing about social media and digital advertising. Their main marketing strategy simply involves word of mouth. In fact, Casper’s Sausage Company doesn’t even have their own website. Cappy created a Twitter account roughly nine years ago in attempts to promote the newly created sausage company, however quickly abandoned it after only a few Tweet attempts.

Plan Overview

For this social media and online promotion strategic plan, I will focus on maximizing the Twitter account that already exists, as well as crafting ideas for Facebook promotions, considering this is where their largest customer base resides online. Most of their existing target audiences are friends and customers they have had for decades who are in similar demographic groups to them. Therefore, these individuals have similar social media tendencies mentioned above. The platform these groups use most frequently is Facebook, so in an effort to effectively reach the audience they already have and keep them interested in business initiatives, the company should put effort towards creating longer promotional posts fit for Facebook’s layout.   

After the current customer base has been reached effectively, Casper’s Sausage Company should put effort towards widening their audience reach. This is where Twitter will come into play. I will draft tweets promoting the products and services and create unique and relevant hashtags to expand the potential reach. I will also take other steps to expand and build up the existing Twitter account which currently has only 6 followers and no profile or cover photo. Part of this will also include doing research on potential competitors and other accounts that could be relevant to follow. The language that will be used in Tweets should also be different than that of the Facebook posts. This is because the type of audiences that will be targeted by the Twitter account will ideally be younger and more social media savvy than the older, previously established customer base that is more likely to be reached by Facebook. It will also be valuable to include posts from the perspective of someone running a marketing campaign for the company, as well as the perspective of someone on the inside promoting themselves.

However, before any of these steps can occur effectively, a functional website must be created where customers can place online orders of sausage either in individual quantities or in bulk for restaurants or other vendors. It will be important to create content that can appeal to every type of potential customer. This includes not only individuals looking to buy for their own personal consumption, but also Italian restaurants looking to source their food locally and support small businesses in the area.
