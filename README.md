# Casper’s Sausage Company: A Strategic Digital & Social Media Plan
## By: Camille Balistreri

Background

In 2008, my grandparents, Casper (Cappy) and Sara Balistreri began their own company making homemade Italian sausage in their hometown of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This initiative followed the selling of the Venice Club, an authentic Italian restaurant that was their life’s work. They owned and operated the restaurant for nearly 30 years after taking it over from Cappy’s mother, my great-grandmother. The sausage company has brought success to my extended family in the past decade. Over the years my grandparents have become staples of their Italian-American community in the Milwaukee area and have dozens of lifelong customers that followed them from the restaurant business to the sausage company. They sell their different varieties of sausage primarily at a local farmers market, as well as wholesale to restaurants.
